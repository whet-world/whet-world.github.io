        <h1 tabindex="0">Quick Tips for Live Music Inclusion</h1>
        <p class="strapline">Music lovers are people of all abilities, and creating a welcoming, accessible and inclusive environment encourages your local music scene to become a space for everyone.</p>
<p class="strapline">The following tips are far from exhaustive, and it’s always highly recommended that you seek the advice of professional accessibility consultants, occupational therapists - and most importantly - patrons with lived experience of disability within your community, before embarking on making any major adjustments to your space.</p>

<h2>LIGHTS</h2>
<p>Employing a Stage lighting policy in place for all regular and visiting lighting and vision engineers is very important, as effects such as strobing, fast flashing or quickly changing lighting or on screen visuals can negatively affect both audiences and performers who may experience epilepsy, migraines, sensory sensitivity or other physiological or cognitive differences. Avoid lights flashing at speeds faster than 3 flashes per second, and for any longer than a 5 second period. The potential negative impact of flashing can be reduced by ensuring there are other sources of consistent light on stage at the same time. Avoid use of repeating patterns or overwhelming visual content if using LED screens.
Displaying a warning message prior to any live sets with dynamic lighting or visual content is important, so that patrons who may have sensitivities can choose how they will engage safely with the show.</p>
<p>Service counters such as bars and kitchen windows should feature effective, glare free and consistent lighting. Ensure that this lighting is not facing directly into the eyes of any customer, either at standing level or in a seated position. Lighting should not be flickering or flashing. Bathrooms, entranceways and stairwells should also have bright, consistent lighting, allowing patrons to clearly see any steps, stairs, doorways or other potential hazards. Although it may not be ideal for ambience, consider having at least dim lighting in crowd areas of band rooms, to allow for communication between patrons in sign languages.</p>

<h2>SOUND</h2>
<p>With a small venue, you may have less control over the way sound travels and bounces off surfaces. Wherever you can, try to ensure that speaker stacks are not facing directly towards audience members in the front of the room, or create a physical space between the speakers and audience. Offer free earplugs at the entrance or bar, in a prominent and ideally self serve set up, able to be reached from a seated position.</p>
<p>If possible, it can be valuable to create a ‘low sensory space’ within the venue - where the sound of music is dulled or blocked out entirely. The area should feature comfortable seating and tables, soft warm lighting, and be climate controlled. This way, patrons who experience sensory sensitivity, migraines, fatigue or any other condition can find short term respite without needing to leave the venue.</p>

<h2>FACILITIES</h2>
<p>Service counters such as bars should be accessible from a seated position - ideally, no higher than 1000mm. If this is not possible due to existing infrastructure, service staff should be ready to assist patrons by offering to take their order or hand their drinks and food directly on the public side of the bar, rather than reaching over the counter. Offering extra assistance and waiting for direction from a patron is important to maintain respect for their autonomy.</p>
<p>Having at least one all gender Accessible bathroom is a requirement by law of newer buildings, but if your venue was constructed before this was codified, there are still improvements you can make to existing bathrooms. Installing grab rails (ideally left and right hand) into cubicles as per AS 1428.1-2009 can be a huge help to ambulant patrons. Ensuring that taps, door handles and locking mechanisms, soap and hand drying facilities are all easy to reach and operate with limited dexterity can make all the difference.</p>
