        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p class="strapline">In My Way is an organisation committed to education and advocacy for accessibility and inclusion in the Naarm live music scene.</p>
        <p>Disability led and not for profit, In My Way seeks to challenges assumptions about the ways that people can and do enjoy live music, and offer free resources and information on the ways that live music venues and promoters can extend access to their events, in order to allow a truly diverse community of music loves and makers to thrive.</p>

        <h1>Live Industry Forum</h1>
        <p>To celebrate the launch of In My Way in Naarm, we will be holding a free live industry forum, to discuss the ways in which people at every level of the music industry can contribute to cultivating more inclusive experiences. With a panel of music lovers and workers, all with their own lived experience of disability or barriers to accessing live music, we will examine the micro and macro adjustments that can open up live events to more potential attendees, and how to overcome discomfort and fear of failure when it comes to understanding the diverse needs of your current or potential future audiences.</p>
        <p>The forum will take place at Music Market, inside Collingwood Yards, and will also be live streamed over Zoom. The event will be Auslan interpreted for both in person and online attendees, with thanks to Auslan Stage Left, and the online component will also feature live captioning.</p>
